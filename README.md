Instructions


Code and File Submission:
Write a single Java program that fulfills the requirements below.
Name the file InvertedTriangle.java.
Submit only this one .java file for your code.
Create a separate folder for your output files.

Program Requirements:
Your program must use a method (e.g., main) to handle both user input and the printing logic.
The program should prompt the user to enter a positive integer for the triangle's height.
Using nested loops, generate and print an inverted right triangle pattern of asterisks (*). The number of rows in the triangle must be equal to the height entered by the user.

Output Requirements:
To demonstrate your program's functionality, capture screenshots of its output for at least two different inputs. You must use the provided examples with heights of 5 and 8. You may also include one additional input of your own choosing.
The screenshots must clearly show both the input prompt and the resulting triangle pattern.
Save these screenshots as .png files. Name them clearly (e.g., Output_Height_5.png, Output_Height_8.png).

Example Input and Output:


Input: Height = 5

Output:

Inverted Right Triangle:
